# Day 3: Linux files and directories

## Linux Differences
- Files hold data while Directories are containers for files and other Directories
- Absolute Path is the path from the root directory. This path never changes.
- Relative Path is the path from the curreent directory. This path changes depending on the current directory

## Commands
- touch: create a new file
- mkdir: create a directory
- cp: copy a file and give the copy a name
- mv: moves a file to a new directory, or renames a file
- rm: deletes a file.
- rmdir: deletes an empty directory

## Deleting a full directory
- rm -r will delete a directory as well all the contents inside of it.
- could accidently delete everything
- rmdir is much safer to use
