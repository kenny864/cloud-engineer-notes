# Day 4: Viewing files and logs in Linux

## What logs are and why they matter
- timestamped records of events, message, and activites generated by the kernel, applicaitons, and services running on the system.
- used for monitoring system health, troubleshooting errors, securing infrastructure, and auditing activites

## System Logs vs Service Logs
- System Logs: Track core OS events, kernel messages, boot processes, and general system activity.
Purpose: diagnosing hardware issues, system crashes, and core system-level problems.

- Service Logs: Track specific activites of individual applicaitons or services (e.g., a web server, database, mail server, SSH).
Purpose: Troubleshooting application-specific errors, tracking user actions within an app, and monitoring service performance.

## Know the difference between Small files vs Large files
- Small Files: high overhead due to numerous open, read, and close system calls. 
Inode limitations can be reached causing "No space left on device" errors even if disk space remains.
Use efficient filesystems like XFS or EXT4 (with proper config). Consider packing small files into larger archives (tar).
Usage: Source code repositories, small logs, config files.

- Large Files: generally higher throughput, especially for sequential reads, as fewer metadata operations are required.
Framentation can occur, although EXT4 handles this well.
Use SSDs for improved IOPS(input/output operations per second).
Usage: Databases, media files, disk images.

- Managing fewer larger files is more efficient that many small files because there is less metadata overhead and increased directory traversal.

# Static files vs growing log files
- Static Files: (e.g., binaries, images, HTML) pre-created, unchangeable, and secured, offering faster, cacheable, and direct delivery without server-side processing.
- Growing files: (like logs, databease records in /var) change constantly. They require active management, frequent backups, and higher I/O to manage their increasing size.
They also require careful permissions and are vulenerable to disk-filling attacks.

## What are these commands and what are they used for:
- cat: used to read, display, and manipulate from the command line.
I used it to quickly display the contents
- less: similar to cat, but it applies pagination
My guess is that this is more useful for large files
Multiple pages allows us to navigate through larger files
- head: Displays the first few lines of a file
- tail: Displays the last few lines of a file
- tail -f: 

## When to use cat vs less
- cat is better for small files because it displays everything
- less is better for larger files because it applies pagination 

## Why tail -f is useful in cloud environments
- tail shows the last 25 lines
- tail -f shows the last 25 lines but allows these lines to be constantly updating.

## One real-world use case (your own words)
- During an attack, I can use tail -f to see the last 25 people to log in to hopefully see where the attack is coming from.
