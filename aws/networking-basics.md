# Basic Linux networking commands

## What ip a shows
- shows the ip adress of the current system
- look at the one that doesn't say lo

## What ping tests
- watches packets respond and records the time
- if it responds, machine has internet access

## What curl is used for
- curl confirms if you see your nginx page
- useful for troubleshooting the server

## One real-world troubleshooting scenario
- use ip a to get the ip address
- plug the ip address into ping to see if we are able to get packets
- plug the ip address into curl to see if we get the html code
